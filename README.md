# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project 🐦📊

## Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on a large dataset of Twitter messages (1.6 million tweets) to classify messages as positive or negative. The goal is to build a robust natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that cleans raw tweet data, extracts features, trains a classification model, and evaluates its performance.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of **1.6 million pre-labeled Twitter messages**.
- Each tweet contains:
  - Sentiment label (0 = negative, 1 = positive)
  - Tweet ID
  - Timestamp
  - Query (mostly `NO_QUERY`)
  - Twitter username
  - Full tweet text
- Source: [Original Twitter Sentiment dataset, 2009]

---

## Key Objectives
- Preprocess raw tweets by removing noise (URLs, mentions, special characters).
- Remove stopwords and perform stemming on tweet text.
- Convert cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Train a logistic regression classifier to predict sentiment labels.
- Evaluate model accuracy and interpret key results.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data ingestion and manipulation
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming)
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning (TF-IDF vectorization, logistic regression)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis and prototyping

---


## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with advanced models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Add sentiment visualization dashboards.
- Expand to multi-class sentiment classification.
